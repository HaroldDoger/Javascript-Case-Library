// So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1]
// as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
// [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
// But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature?
//   As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:
// [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
// Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear:
//  you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.
// Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number;
//  if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) 
//  and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

function tribonacci(signature,n){  
    for (var i = 3; i < n; i++) { 
      signature.push(signature[i-1] + signature[i-2] + signature[i-3]); 
    }
    return signature.slice(0, n); 
  }
